.SH Modern Mode
.PP
Protocol 73 extends the classic rsync protocol with optional features
that are negotiated when both peers invoke \f[V]oc-rsync\f[R] with the
\f[V]--modern\f[R] flag or one of its sub-flags.
.SS Stronger checksums
.PP
\f[V]--modern\f[R] or \f[V]--modern-hash\f[R] upgrades the strong file
checksum to BLAKE3 when supported.
This provides better error detection than MD5 or SHA-1 while remaining
fast.
.SS Enhanced compression
.PP
Modern mode prefers zstd compression and also supports lz4 through the
\f[V]--modern-compress\f[R] option.
When both peers support the algorithm the most efficient codec is
selected automatically.
.SS Content-defined chunking
.PP
The \f[V]--modern-cdc\f[R] flag enables FastCDC chunking to improve
delta reuse between runs.
This is only activated when both sides negotiate protocol 73.
.PP
All modern features require both peers to speak protocol 73; transfers
fall back to stock rsync semantics when a peer does not advertise
support.
