# Metrics

This repository tracks a few high-level engineering metrics. These values help gauge progress toward a production-ready rsync replacement.

## Test pass rate
Percentage of tests that pass when running `cargo test`. The full suite includes integration tests that depend on a local `rsync` binary and may require elevated privileges.

## Coverage
Line coverage for the workspace generated by `make coverage`, which uses `cargo llvm-cov` and writes `reports/coverage.json`.

## Build time
Wall-clock time to build the default workspace with `cargo build` on a clean tree.

## Updating metrics
1. Install tools if needed: `cargo install cargo-llvm-cov`.
2. Measure build time:
   ```bash
   cargo clean && time cargo build
   ```
3. Run tests and note pass counts:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```
4. Generate coverage data:
   ```bash
   make coverage
   ```
5. Update `reports/daily_estimate.md` (or extend CI to run `cargo xtask status` after these steps).
