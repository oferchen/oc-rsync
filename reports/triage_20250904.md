# Triage Report - 2025-09-04

## Summary
`cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features` fails during compilation.

## Failures
- **engine crate**: linking step for test target failed.
  - Error: `/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lacl: No such file or directory`
  - Root cause: missing system library `libacl` (POSIX ACL support) required during link.

## Recommendations
- Install the development package providing `libacl` (e.g., `apt-get install libacl1-dev`).
- Alternatively, adjust build configuration to disable ACL-dependent code when the library is unavailable.
